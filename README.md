# Hangman

Simple implementation of a hangman game using a word server and a client player.

# How to run

**Compiling with NetBeans**

- Clone the repository
- Open the Server and Client folders on Netbeans
- Compile both projects

You now have two options:
1. Execute on NetBeans
2. Execute via terminal (you can also build via terminal)

Independently of which option you choose, the process is the same:
- Start the Server
- Start the Client
- Provide in the Client the IP address and the port number (you can change these values in the Server class) of the Server
- Enter a username and a key (works like a password)
- Thats it. Now you can interact with the Client and play or see the ranking
